Redfall is in the same boat as Starfield and has been delayed out of this year and into the first half of next year. We don't know when for sure, but its recent gameplay trailer indicates sooner rather than later. Arkane Studios has been on fire recently, and we can easily see this open-world FPS carrying that torch forward and onto new heights.

Bethesda is loading up to have a massive 2023 lineup, and with Starfield and Redfall leading the charge in the first half of the year, they will be cooking with fire early. We want nothing more than a cooperative, current-generation, open-world FPS, and Redfall will scratch that itch nicely.</h1>
